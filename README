SHERPASURFING is an open source Cyber Security Solution


The objective of the project is for those individuals and organizations who
need a low cost solution for Cybersecurity will have one. In addition, to
those individuals and organizations who want to use some of the components
PLEASE do. The intent is to provide a resource and if you ever have 
questions please let contact me or one of my awesome contributors. If one piece
of code makes a difference than it is all worth while. 

The contributors, these are the people who have influenced and made this possible. 
The tools and tradecraft provided here are a product of their dedication and
professionalism.

Platforms

I have broadened the supported platform based on discussions to include components
for NOSQL platforms including: Apache, CLOUDERA and Accumalo (Based on requests). 

Project Repository Roadmap

common - Common elements and utilities that are used across the project will be located
in this directory. All of the utilities that we have for working with data that will improve the security posture of an organization.

decorators - In the SHERPA model, we have used decorators like many organizations to format data correctly and in an optimal form for analysis. Decorators have been phased
out in Flume 1.1.* in favor or interceptors so we will publish all of the decorators
that have been developed, peered and tested for use. We are in the process of moving
these to the Interceptor model. The src directory will provide decorators and interceptors java source code.

doc - The doc directory is a reference set on how to install components, configure them and how they are used. Some of the documents in this directory are notes, that can be used for tuning and just thinking through some of the initial challenges of moving into the NOSQL world. The project will be providing a roadmap for building a solution from the ground up.

enrichment - The enrichment (taking something and adding value) sources are provided in a variety of forms so that they can used with Hive, HDFS, HBASE and Accumalo for correlation. The DDL (when applicable) and the utilities to format the data will be provided in this directory with instructions on how to use them.

framework - The analytic framework is provided as a simple machanism for running analytic jobs on the platform. The intent of the framework is to be flat and simple since it is intended to support a broad audience. The src directory will provide the framework source so that it can be extended or modified.

silk - We have provided a simple set of configurations for installation and configuration of Silk to collect netflow within an organization. Silk is one of many different data types that will be provided. The intent is to provide base configurations so that organizations can get started with the tools provided.

sample data - We will be providing generated sample data in order to test and ensure that the components are working correctly.

analytics - The analytics directory will contain a base pattern (empty) for an analytic and several sample analytics. The src directory will provide all of the source code for the provided analytics.
