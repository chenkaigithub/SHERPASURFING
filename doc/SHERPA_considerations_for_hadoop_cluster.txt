Key lesson learned, Cache intermediate results in the iteration stages using -cacheFile

Out of band Tasktracker heartbeat: Set mapreduce.tasktracker.outofband.heartbeat = true
Expert: Set this to true to let the tasktracker send an out-of-band heartbeat on task-completion for better latency.

Top Five Issues

1.Insufficient memory in the nodes given the Hadoop configuration and the other processes running
2.Too many small files used as input to MapReduce jobs
3.Poor (or non-existent) job submission management a.Unlimited jobs can be submitted by each user
b.FairScheduler not being configured effectively

4.Default HDFS block size is almost always too small 64MB should be increases to 128MB/256MB

5.Too many Map spills to disk will merging emitted data for the reducer  the objective is one per Map task.
