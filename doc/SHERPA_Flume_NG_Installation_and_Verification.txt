These installation, configuration and verification steps come from my own installation

-- Originated and verified 06/2012
-- Peer reviewed 6/15/2012

ALL COMMAND Lines are in double quotes "command line" [buttons]


Pre-reqs

- download of the flume NG tarball
- No previous installation of Flume present on the machine
- If connecting, point to point, the two machines MUST be able to see each other. (connectivity) Node/Sink
- Determine where the installation will take place, most respectfully, I recommend that you not use /usr/local if possible,  part of the defense that software such as this should NEVER if possible be in a predictable location. (Your choice)


Installation

- move the tarball to the machine and directory for installation
- cd to the directory that contains the tarball for flume NG (recommended location is /usr/local)
* Note: when the tarball is expanded it will create a flume-ng directory
- Run the command "sudo tar -zxvf <flume ng tarball name>.tar.gz"
- Now, we need to set the Flume configuration directory so that when the process starts up it can find the properties file required: "export FLUME_CONF_DIR=/usr/local/flume-ng/conf"
- Recommend adding this to .bash_profile
	1.) From a linux console "cd [enter]"
	2.) vi ~/.bash_proflle
	3.) Move to the point in the file to add the line
	4.) "[escape] [o] [escape] [i]" (add line and put editor in line mode)
	5.) add "export FLUME_CONF_DIR=/usr/local/flume-ng/conf"
	6.) "[escape] wq"

- Recommend installing the installation, they wrote it and it is a resource
- Install the appplication and docs "sudo apt-get install flume-ng-agent flume-ng-doc"
- A sample prop file is provided by Flume in the FLUME_CONF_DIR directory
- Copy the sample file provided to the conf directory
- "cp $FLUME_CONF_DIR/flume-conf.properties.template $FLUME_CONF_DIR/flume.conf"
- Customize Flume NG to ensure that it has adequate memory
- Copy the environmental setup "cp $FLUME_CONF_DIR/flume-env.sh.template $FLUME_CONF_DIR/flume-env.sh
- Based on some of the setting that were used during testing
- Recommend adding this to .flume-env.sh
	1.) From a linux console "cd [enter]"
	2.) vi $FLUME_CONF_DIR/flume-env.sh
	3.) Uncomment the line for JAVA_OPT (remove #)
	4.) change the JAVA_OPTS to "-Xmx256m" 
	5.) "[escape] wq"

Installation completed move to verification

Verification

- Open another console window
- type "echo $FLUME_CONF_DIR" , ensure that it is pointed to the flume installation
- type "echo $PATH , ensure that flume has been added to the PATH correctly
- type "flume-ng help" which should return with the help menu
* NOTE: it is no longer flume it is flume-ng and the command "flume version" has been deprecated
EXPECTED RESULTS: the help menu options for flume ng will be listed
 
Final Notes:

If you add custom code, you will need to uncomment FLUME_CLASSPATH
